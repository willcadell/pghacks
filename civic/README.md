This PG Hacks is all about CIVIC DATA and how we can collaboratively create, build, and invent new solutions using publicly-released data, code and technology to solve challenges relevant to our local neighborhoods & cities.
 

For those of you who like to prepare, here are some questions to ask yourself when you're trying to think about a civic problem that you might be able to solve with technology:

How can technology help to solve problems that city planners and organizers have to deal with all the time?
What are problems faced by our communities that you think technology can be the solution?
Where can the city support their 'clients' (people) more effectively using technology?
Examples:

How can technology help people find their voting place?
How can technology remind / support people in accessing live streamed board / council meetings?
How can technology give garbage / snow clearing schedules?
Is participatory budgeting application possible?
How can technology support public consultation?
Parking ticket reminders?
Can we better inform people of what can be recycled at which recycling places? 

Typically, large organizations tend to focus on themselves and that's natural. We, as civic hackers, have the opportunity to take a citizen focused perspective on municipal activities.
 

If you are still stumped, think about municipal activities in categories, such as: 

Financing eg. Budgeting
Planning eg. Zoning,
Services eg. Snow removal, garbage
Public Safety eg. 9-1-1 support

Once you have your problem, what kind of data is available? 


Well many of Canada's municipalities publish 'open data' websites. Check out the links below for local examples or perhaps you want to look at the data first, and then come up with problems that you think you can solve.
